# Project Description:
## Overview:
- This project consists of various models implemented using classical Machine Learning algorithms on open source datasets.

## Tech Stack:
- Used Google Colaboratory for implementaion.
- Language: Python.
- Also used various Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Scikit-Learn.

## Algorithms Used:
### Linear Regression:
- In linear regression, we obtain an estimate of the unknown variable (denoted by y; the output of our model) by computing a weighted sum of our known variables (denoted by xáµ¢; the inputs) to which we add a bias term.

- We can obtain the weight matrix using 2 methods:
    1. Normal Equation Method (Linear Algebra approach)
    2. Gradient Descent Method (Using Calculus to  minimize the error function)

### Logistic Regression:
- Logistic regression is a statistical/regression analysis method used when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).

- Logistic Regression converts the straight best fit line in linear regression to an S-curve using the sigmoid function.

### Neural Networks:
- Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
- Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold.
    - If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network.
    - Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.
- Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time.
